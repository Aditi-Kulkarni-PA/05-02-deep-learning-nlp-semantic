    "In Semantic Role Labelling (SRL), words and phrases are analysed to determine their roles in an event or action.\n",

    "- “Mary gave John a book.”\n",
    "- Mary → Agent (the doer)\n",
    "- John → Recipient (the receiver)\n",
    "- a book → Theme (the thing being given)\n",

    "It generates sentences by filling predefined templates with variable values using handcrafted rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "In rule-based or template-based text generation, systems use predefined sentence patterns (templates) and linguistic rules to create grammatically correct outputs.\n",
    "Each template contains slots that are filled with context-specific values.\n",

    "- Template → “Dear [Name], your order [Order_ID] has been [Status].”\n",
    "- Output → “Dear Aditi, your order #4589 has been shipped.”\n"
