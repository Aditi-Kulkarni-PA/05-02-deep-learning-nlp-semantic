        "\n",
        "In this exercise, we will focus on **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**, a core task in Information Extraction that identifies and classifies proper nouns (entities) into predefined categories like Person, Organisation, or Location. We will use the powerful `spaCy` library to perform NER and then introduce the **IOB (Inside-Outside-Beginning)** tagging scheme, which is the standard method for representing entity boundaries and types programmatically. Understanding both the spaCy output and the IOB scheme is vital for building and evaluating custom NER systems. And, like the last exercise, we will use a small sample input from our email summary dataset to understand the concepts in more depth."
